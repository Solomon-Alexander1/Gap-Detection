# Gap-Detection
YOLOv8-based gap and number detection model using real-time object detection.

# Gap and Number Detection using YOLOv8

This project was developed during my internship at Clustor Computing.  
It uses YOLOv8 to detect and measure the gap between two objects, and also to detect numbers in images or video streams.

## Files Included
- `Gap Detection Main.py` – Detects and measures gap between objects.
- `Number Detection Main.py` – Detects numbers using YOLOv8.
- `camera_test.py` & `camera_test1.py` – For webcam testing.
- `train.py` – Script to train YOLOv8 on custom data.
- `data.yaml` – Configuration file for training.
- `yolov8n.pt` and `yolov8s.pt` – Pretrained YOLOv8 models.

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
2. Run any script:
